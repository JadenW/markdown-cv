## Experience
**Senior Software Engineer, VoltDB,Inc (Feb 2018 – Present)**  
Work for Core team, which is responsible for database storage, query optimization and distributed transactions.  
	- Optimized database storage layer by supporting single replicated table per node, which greatly reduce memory footprint usage when customer has large reference tables and still maintain low query latency;  
	- Overhauled memory allocation strategy by replacing force compacting pool to self compacting pool, which achieved much predictable latency;  
	- Improved cluster stability by gracefully repair data divergence among replicas; 
	- Designed and implement scalable transaction scheduler for support concurrent execution of multi partition transactions, which improved throughput for "credit-debit" type application by order of magnitude.

**Software Engineer, VoltDB,Inc (Jan 2016 – Feb 2018)**  
Work for Elastic team, which is responsible for database high available features,
such as Write Ahead Logging, Snapshot and Data Replication.  
	- Extended Cross Datacenter Data Replication by adding support for Multi Clusters Active-Active replication;  
	- Improved cluster orchestration with elastically expansion and contraction feature, which can dynamically add or remove nodes from running cluster without disturbing transaction.

**Software Engineer Intern, VoltDB,Inc (May 2015 - Dec 2015)**  
Work for Ecosystem team, which focus on implement, optimize and troubleshot database clients, ETL tooling and upstream/downstream connectors.  
	- Developed Connectors for Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis and Elastic Search;  
	- Extended SQL testing framework by injecting randomly generated SQL statements;  
	- Implement SNMP Capable Resource Monitors.

**Software Engineer Intern, Amazon Web Services (May 2014 - Aug 2014)**  
Work for Elastic Block Store (EBS) team, which offers block level storage volumes for Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances.  
	- Implement data aggregation tools using Hive and Elastic MapReduce (EMR);   
	- Prototyped large scale internal monitoring and data analysis service. 

**Software Engineer Intern, Broadcom Corp (May 2012 - Aug 2012)**  
Work for Mobile and Wireless Group, developed automation tools for WCDMA performance analysis and modem simulation platform. 

## Education
**Worcester Polytechnic Institute (2012-2015)** – Ph.D Candidate (quit), Computer Science
**Worcester Polytechnic Institute (2010-2012)** – MS, Computer Science
